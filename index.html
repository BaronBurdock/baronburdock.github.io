            <p>
I always have a project or two waiting in the wing – most of them never get off the ground and those that do eventually stall out, much to my wife’s frustration. Occasionally things get done...this year I am setting out to build a custom fightstick.

            <p>
I had largely forgotten about this blog until I started playing around with Nostr. This is my attempt to jot down my process in setting up a NIP-05 identifier, as well as provide a summary of what Nostr is. If this all sounds like tech gibberish, keep reading.

            <h2><a href="pages/20220829.html">2022 08 29: The Beatles Yellow Album</a></h2>
            <p>
Just about every Beatles fan out there has attempted to come up with their own post-Beatles mix. For the uninitiated, I would highly recommend looking into Ethan Hawke’s Black Album compilation which was featured in the movie Boyhood – It’s excellent. At any rate, I attempted to come up with my own post-Beatles compilation, but with the Red and Blue Albums as my inspiration. My parents introduced me to the Beatles through these two compilations and they are special to me. A “Yellow Album” was the logical starting point for a post-Beatles greatest hits.

            <h2><a href="pages/20220815.html">2022 08 15: Goldbacks</a></h2>
            <p>
I’ve wanted to make the trek to Porcupine Freedom Festival (Porcfest) for years now, and every year it seems to escape me. While spending another year living variously through everyone's social media posts, I found that quite a attendees were using Goldbacks to purchase things from vendors (I loved the “Dirty fiat grudgingly accepted stickers”). I believe this marks the second or third year that Goldback has made an appearance at Porcfest. Where I've never looked into Goldbacks before, I decided to purchase some notes and give my thoughts.

            <h2><a href="pages/20220801.html">2022 08 01: SNES Cartridge Brain Dump</a></h2>
            <p>
For most of my life the innards of my game cartridges were largely a mystery. You simply put these these magical chunks of plastic into your console and they worked…and if they didn't, you blew on them until they did. This post is essentially a brain dump about everything I have learned about SNES cartridges.I won't be going into too much detail on the PAL SNES and Super Famicom carts as at the time of writing I don't have any to rip open.

            <p>
A couple years ago I pulled the eBay trigger on a Sega Dreamcast. My understanding of the console was as follows: "the Dreamcast was Sega's star-crossed console that tragically died before its time. Desperate to rebuild after the Saturn's colossal failure, the Dreamcast was Sega at its peak: inventive, boundary pushing, offbeat. Given my poor experience with older CD-based consoles in the past, I decided to go a different route with thia Dreamcast. Enter the GDEMU.
