            <h2>2022 05 21: So I’m Starting a Blog…</h2>
            <p>
It's 2022 and I don't actually know if blogs are a thing anymore. Sure they exist- there are many blogging options out there, but I don't know if anyone is actively using/reading them. I suspect personal blogs have gone the way of the dinosaur (because no one wants to read your online diary) and Substack has taken over the niche content space - but I am going to try to start one anyways.
            <p>
            </p>
Blogging, by its very nature, is a masturbatory endeavor. You write hoping that someone will connect with your thoughts in some way, but really you do it for yourself. You start a blog for your own benefit and this blog is no different. My wife and kids are the early-to-bed types, so when things settle down at night, I spend an obscene amount of time doomscrolling through social media. It provides no real benefit to me.
            <p>
            </p>
Even if it's self-indulgent, a blog gives me the opportunity to get back into the habit of writing. From 2008 to 2009 I dipped my toe into blogging with a couple friends. At the time we thought the world was dying to read our opinions on games, movies, and albums. I wanted to be the next Maddox who was big at the time. Absolutely no one read it, but it was a fun exercise. Years later, writing has become a challenge - business emails, excel sheets, text messages and the mind-rotting sludge that is Twitter have killed my ability to write in an appealing manner (subject, verb, object - don't bore us get to the chorus).
            <p>
            </p>
This will serve as a brain dump for things that I come across. I plan to write about things that interest me - electronics, retrogaming and liberty. From time to time I tackle a project or two, I might put them on here as well. I fully anticipate that my first posts will be a little rough around the edges. I doubt that anyone will actually read this, but please bear with me if you do.
