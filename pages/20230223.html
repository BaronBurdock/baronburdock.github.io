<p>
I always have a project or two waiting in the wing – most of them never get off the ground and those that do eventually stall out, much to my wife’s frustration. Occasionally things get done...this year I am setting out to build a custom fightstick. 
</p>
<p>
So why a fightstick? Although I’m terrible at it, I’ve been playing a lot of Street Fighter III: Third Strike for Dreamcast and I just can’t get my fingers to  play nice with the triggers when doing specials. Naturally I started hunting for a Dreamcast Arcade Stick, only to find that the starting price on eBay is about $80 for a poorly maintained unit. Even if I managed to find a decent stick, I would be forking out $80 for a controller that I could only use for one console - and really only one game. If I wanted more arcade sticks, I would need to fork out for everyone console I own. I don’t have space for that many joysticks, and more importantly, I don’t have the money for that either. This line of thinking led me down the road of a multi-system stick. This is fairly easy to accomplish on modern consoles using USB or Bluetooth, for older consoles this is much more difficult. There are no standard plugs, every controller is different, and adapters can often add latency.
</p>
<p>
To get around this issue, my fightstick is going to rely heavily on padhacking, or soldering the joystick buttons and controls to existing controllers. Padhacking is not new to fightsticks. In many cases, builders use padhacking to cheaply connect joystick parts to consoles. These padhacks are generally incorporated into the stick – once you padhack a GameCube controller, you now have a GameCube arcade stick. My fightstick will be somewhat unique in that I plan on doing padhacks for every console that I own. Instead of being hardwired into the stick, each padhacked controller will attach to the joystick through a dsub 37 pin connector. I chose a 37 pin connector because it guarantees enough lines  for various controller inputs for all consoles to have their own circuits – four directions, four face buttons, four shoulder buttons, four menu buttons, and spares. This is clearly overkill. No controller requires 37 wires to attach to the console. My thinking here is that giving each input its its own circuit gives me flexibility for any controller that I come across. Most have a common ground that will work with all the buttons, but I think there are some weird ones – the 360 controller comes to mind. 
</p>
<p>
Initially my plan was to use cheap, Aliexpress controllers for their boards, cables and plugs, but I found the quality was so lacking that it wouldn't be worth the effort. I plan on using OEM or older third party controllers. In the event that an OEM controller is used, I plan on using something that's already damaged – no sense ruining a perfectly good controller. 
</p>
<p>
As far as constructing the stick enclosure, I haven’t figured that out yet. I think I am going to need build something custom which I will detail later. There are some great metal and acrylic options out there, but I am going to need extra space to put each controller board. As for materials, I’m thinking a combination of wood and acrylic, but that's as far as I have gotten. The fightstick is going to be comprised of the following parts (rough costs included):
</p>
<p>
1x Sanwa JLF-TP-8YT Joystick = $24.00<br>
1x Sanwa GT-Y Octagonal Restrictor Gate = $5.00<br>
1x Sanwa Mounting Plate JLF-P1-S = $5.00<br>
8x Sanwa OBSF 30mm Pushbuttons = $24.00<br>
4x 16mm Panel Mount Pushbutton (menus) = $4.00<br>
1x DB37 D-Sub Cable = $10.00<br>
50x 22 AWG Wire with .187 Quick Disconnects = $24.00<br>
TOTAL = $96.00<br>
</p>
<p>
As for each padhacked controller, I suppose the skies the limit. I assume something like:
</p>
<p>
Broken Controller = $10.00<br>
D-Sub 37-pin Connector Breakout Board = $8.00<br>
Enclosure = $5.00<br>
TOTAL = $23.00<br>
</p>
<p>
Looking at this now, this is not going to be a cheap (or easy) project. I still like the idea of using one joystick with high quality parts on all of my consoles. More to follow on this.
